## Description
> Running is a great form of exercise, and one of the greatest aspects of running is that you burn a lot of calories.  The best part about burning a lot of calories is the fact that you get to EAT a lot of calories.  That’s why we developed Run4.  It’s an app for fun runs involving food and drink, because we run for pizza… or whatever you want.
